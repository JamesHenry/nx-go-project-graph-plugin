NOTE: This example was created to illustrate to the community how to write a plugin for Nx to add Go support for things like project graph construction.

The API for Nx Plugins has changed since this example repository was created.

ℹ️ Please take a look at the plugin https://github.com/nx-go/nx-go if you want to use Go and Nx together.
